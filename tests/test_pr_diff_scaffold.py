"""
This scaffold exists because the PR diff context wasn't available to the generator.
Replace these placeholder tests with comprehensive unit tests that focus on the PR's changed code.

Guidance:
- Using unittest style due to absence of detected pytest configuration.
- Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions for all public interfaces touched in the PR.
- Mock external dependencies and I/O with unittest.mock.
- Keep tests deterministic and readable with clear naming.
